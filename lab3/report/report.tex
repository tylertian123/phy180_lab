\documentclass[aps,twocolumn,secnumarabic,nobalancelastpage,amsmath,amssymb,nofootinbib,floatfix]{revtex4}

% Documentclass Options
    % aps, prl, rmp stand for American Physical Society, Physical Review Letters, and Reviews of Modern Physics, respectively
    % twocolumn permits two columns, of course
    % nobalancelastpage doesn't attempt to equalize the lengths of the two columns on the last page
        % as might be desired in a journal where articles follow one another closely
    % amsmath and amssymb are necessary for the subequations environment among others
    % secnumarabic identifies sections by number to aid electronic review and commentary.
    % nofootinbib forces footnotes to occur on the page where they are first referenced
        % and not in the bibliography
    % REVTeX 4 is a set of macro packages designed to be used with LaTeX 2e.
        % REVTeX is well-suited for preparing manuscripts for submission to APS journals.
